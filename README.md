# SafeHaven
The actual Unity game / Build of Safe Haven

## Coding guidelines
Go to [Coding Guidelines](https://github.com/AIM-GAME-PROJECT-group-b/SafeHaven/wiki/Coding-Guidelines) in the Wiki

## GIT and github rules/guidelines

1. the main branch is only for a working version of the unity project. You should ***NEVER*** push or create a pull request directly to this branch.
2. the develop branch is used as an integration and test point before the main branch. If you have a working feature that you want to add to the game you should make a pull request to this branch. If you want to start working on a new feature then you should use this branch as a starting point for your own branch.
3. Branches should be named like this: ```[Branch_Type]-[Branch_Name]```. For example, if you want to add a flowing river to the project, your branch should be called ```Feature-flowing_water```, or if you want to add a model of a brigde, your branch should be called ```Art-small_brigde```
    The branch types are (work in progress):
    1. Feature  
    Used for new features.
    2. Bug  
    Used for bugfixes.
    3. Art  
    Used for the import of new art assets.
    4. WIP  
    Used for experiments, not something you nessesarily want to merge with the develop branch.
